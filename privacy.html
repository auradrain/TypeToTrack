<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: January 1, 2026</p>

<p>TypeToTrack ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the TypeToTrack mobile application.</p>

<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p>When using TypeToTrack, you may provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meal descriptions entered as text or voice</li>
  <li>Optional weight data (via Apple Health, if enabled)</li>
  <li>Basic profile information such as age, height, and gender (used only to calculate nutrition goals)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
<p>Your meal descriptions are processed by our backend AI system to generate nutritional estimates (calories, macros, and micronutrients).</p>

<p>Profile information (age, height, gender) is stored locally on your device and is <strong>not transmitted to our servers</strong>.</p>

<p>If you enable Apple Health integration, weight data is read from Apple Health only to display progress within the app. We do not store or transmit Health data outside your device.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
Meal logs and profile data are stored locally on your device.  
Meal text submitted for AI analysis is transmitted securely to our servers for processing and returned with nutritional information.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>TypeToTrack uses third-party AI services to process meal descriptions for nutritional analysis. These services process data solely to generate nutrition results and do not use your information for advertising.</p>

<p>Subscriptions are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. We do not have access to your payment details.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use secure HTTPS connections to transmit data. While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may disable Apple Health access at any time in iOS Settings.</li>
  <li>You may delete the app to remove all locally stored data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>TypeToTrack is not intended for children under 13 years of age.</p>
